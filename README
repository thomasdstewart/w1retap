w1retap - One wire sensor logging.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

w1retap is a system for logging data from a 1-wire weather sensors to
either a relational database or files (or combination thereof). 

w1retap spports any (reasonable) number of following sensors from AAG
Electr√≥nica (AAG) <http://www.aagelectronica.com/>, based on Dallas
Semiconductors <http://www.dalsemi.com/> devices.

* TAI8520 (DS1820 / DS18S20) Temperature sensors;
* TAI8540B (DS2438) Humidity Sensor;
* TAI8570 Pressure Sensor;
* TAI8575 Rain Gauge.

A number of other sensors, typically "hobby/build your own", are
supported:

* SHT11 based humidity sensor
  <http://home.hetnet.nl/~thomas_7/1Wire/1-WireIOPort.html>
* MPX4115A based pressure sensor ('fronted' by DS2438)
  <http://home.comcast.net/~andrew.g.miller/barometer/>

I do not own a TAI8515 Weather Station / Anemometer, so this is not
supported, but as it is supported by the libusblinux300 SDK, adding
support should be "trivial".

w1retap is designed to run on the Linux operating system and assumes
that the interface between the computer and the 1-wire system is
either a DS2490 USB adaptor or a DS2480 RS232 serial adaptor.

The logging is performed by one or more "plugin" modules, these
currently include:

	Sqlite (version 3)
	PostgreSQL
	MySQL
	ODBC

	Text file
	CSV file
	XML file

Unless otherwise indicated, the system is released under the GNU Public
Licence.
