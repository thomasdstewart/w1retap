w1retap - One wire sensor logging.

w1retap is a system for logging data from a 1-wire weather sensors to
either a relational database or files (or combination thereof). 

The initial release supports any number of the following sensors from
AAG Electr√≥nica (AAG) <http://www.aagelectronica.com/>, based on
Dallas Semiconductors <http://www.dalsemi.com/> devices.

TAI8520 (DS1820 / DS18S20) Temperature sensors;
TAI8540B (DS2438) Humidity Sensor
TAI8570 Pressure Sensor
TAI8575 Rain Gauge

I do not own a TAI8515 Weather Station / Anemometer, so this is not
supported, but as it is supported by the libusblinux300 SDK, adding
support is "trivial".

The logging is performed by one or more "plugin" modules, these
currently include:

	Sqlite (version 3)
	PostgreSQL
	MySQL
	ODBC

	Text file
	CSV file
	XML file

w1retap is designed to run on the Linux operating system and assumes
that the interface between the computer and the 1-wire system is a
DS2490 USB adaptor. As the software is based on the Dallas Semi/Maxim
public domain 1-wire USB SDK, adapting for other interfaces
(e.g.serial) should be trivial.

Unless otherwise indicated, the system is released under the GNU Public
Licence.
