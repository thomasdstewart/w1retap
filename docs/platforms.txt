w1retap is designed to build and run on POSIX systems. This means it
should build and run on Linux with minimal effort, and on other Unix
like systems with a little work.

Linux:

Ubuntu 10.10, Ubuntu 11.04 ia-32,  x86_64 and ppc
Fedora 14 x86_64
Arch (current) ia-32

FreeBSD:

You need to install a libusb.pc in
/usr/local/libdata/pkgconfig/libusb.pc
Then it should build.
