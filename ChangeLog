1.0.3  2007-04-22
       Changed the usb read for DS2490GetStatus() in libusbds2490.c to
       usb_interrupt_read(). This makes it work again on 2.6.20+ kernels.

1.0.2   2007-01-20
        Fixed a configure.ac typo and added some more MySQL checks.
        Renamed docs/README.udev to docs/README.usb and added some notes for
	older Linux systems still using hotplug.
	Check SHT-11 CRCs
	Changed to libpopt for argument parsing
	Vastly improved handling of coupler devices, contributed
	by William R Sowerbutts <http://sowerbutts.com>.
	Default data size changed to double (vice real).

1.0.1	2006-08-26
	Fix documentation errors (no code changes)

1.0	2006-08-22
	
	New functionality, so let's bump the version a bit. This is version
	1.0.

	Pgsql readings table is field order independent (patch contributed
	by William R Sowerbutts <http://sowerbutts.com>). Also applied to
	other databases.

	Altitude (for pressure normalisation) may be set in
	.config/w1retap/rc; if set, pressure will be normalised.
	e.g.
	 altitude = 19

	If you want to store 'raw' local pressure and do the conversion
	else where, then don't define the altitude key in the rc file.

       Timestamps may _optionally_ be stored as SQL TIMESTAMPs if the key

	timestamp = 1

	is set in .config/w1retap/rc. You must create appropriate table
	definition, example schemas and conversion code provided.
	
	Support for new devices
	* DS2409 Coupler (1)
	* DS2480B Serial interface (1)
	* SHT11 based humidity sensor
	 <http://home.hetnet.nl/~thomas_7/1Wire/1-WireIOPort.html> (1)
	* MPX4115A based pressure sensor ('fronted' by DS2438)
	 <http://home.comcast.net/~andrew.g.miller/barometer/> (1)
 	* TAI8515 Weather Vane (the other devices in the TAI8515,
          a DS2423 counter and DS18S20 temperature sensor are already
	  supported). The new code accesses the DS2405, so there is also
	  now support for the DS2450, although this is not obvious to the
	  end user. If you have another DS2450 application, let me
	  know. The code for the TAI8515 was contributed by Will
	  Sowerbutts.
	
	Sensor naming has been rationalised. Please read the manual for
	details. The old names are deprecated and may not be recognised in
	some future release

	The 'w1find' utility will walk the 1-wire network and report all
	devices. DS2409 Microlan couplers are supported, to a single depth
	(i.e. recursive coupler searching is not supported), but you may
	have multipe couplers on the network; in theory, will work with
	the 'Hobbyboards' multiple 2409 device.

	Detection of gnome-applets dependencies improved.

	A dist-bz2 target is provided.

	docs/fix* and docs/mksens*.sql scripts _if desired_ (e.g. for
	pressure normalisation, timestamps vice epoch times, sensor
	names).

	Updated manual (about time too).
	
	(1) Thanks to Mihail Peltekov <http://zlatograd.com> for providing
	ssh access to zlatograd.com to test these devices.

0.0.11  2006-06-04
	Should now be 64 bit clean (at least for my sensors)
	Cleaned up file logging
	Updated udev debugging info

0.0.10  2006-06-03
	Fixed compliation error in w1util.c when sqlite3.h not installed,
	reported by Joe Carter.
	Check for system usb.h, removed obsolete usb.h in Dallas library.
	Documented removal of ds9490r on recent kernels/udev.
	
0.0.9   2006-06-02
	Increased resiliance to psql errors.
	Documented udev setting for non-root operation on recent Linux (e.g.
	Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper.

0.0.8   2006-04-14. (never publically released)
	Reversed the Changelog to have most recent entries at the top.
	Fixed the configure scripts to recognise missing header files for
	odbc and sqlite plugins (reported by Stephen Searby).
	
	Fixed GCC 4 compiler warnings in libusblinux300 (reported by Stephen
	Searby), and in w1odbc.c

	Updated may of the contrib/web scripts, and added reporting to CWOP
	(Citizen Weather Observer Program)

0.0.7	Fixed the egregious memory leak in the pgsql module.
	Fixed the information leak in etemp.

0.0.6   Fixed signed temp values for humidity sensors, thanks to some very
	cold weather.

0.0.5   Fixed MySQL and ODBC plugins
	Added reportlog table
	Changed the GNOME applet to have own configure
	Fixed ratelimit methods

0.0.4   Moved to Ruby scripts. 
	Changed web pages to use CSS.
	Added ratelimit table to catch bogus readings
	Again changed timer algorithm to catch clock being adjusted
	underneath us.
	Added XMLRPC based Gnome applet
	Added configure options to limit what is built
	Fixed memory leaks in applets

0.0.3	Fixed the pgsql driver to actually work.

0.0.2	Add a (code) constraint on the pressure reading (about once a
	month my sensor reports a single value way out of range).

	Add new tables of daily and monthly, maintained by wplot.pl to
	record daily and monthly rainfalls. 

	Make the web page render in MSIE, by downgrading <OBJECT> tags to
	<IMG>. Don't you just hate broken browsers.

	Remove duplicate files and .svn files from the distributed tar
