1.4.1 2012-09-29
	Added support for Postgresql 9.2 JSON column.
	(also suuports JSON formatted text in postgres and sqlite)
	Removed support for Postgres 7.
	Updated the Mongodb driver to libmongo-client. Updated the
	gnome-shell applet for Gnome-shell 3.4.
	Tested/supported on ARM (raspberry-pi).
	Available in Archlinux AUR.
	Added -u --force_utc flag / setting for log times

1.4.0 2011-12-28
	Added a storage driver for Mongodb.

1.3.9 2011-11-19
	Added UK Meteorological Office (http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/)
	Weather Observation Website reporting to contrib/web.
	The author's weather data may be browsed at:
	http://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/latestobservationservlet?siteID=22841429
	No w1retap application changes

1.3.8 2011-11-19
	Updates the sun_moon and added moon_images directories (for Graeme
	Gemmill)
	Add gnome-shell extension (for Daria), remove appindicator, as I
	have no desire to encourage Ubuntu's damage to the GNOME
	platform.

1.3.7 2011-05-08
	Fixed bug whereby defined but empty coupler branches caused
	sensors not to be read (reported by Dave Johns).
	Made building with libxml2 optional (suggested by Koos van den
	Hout). w1retap also builds if libxml2 is not installed.
	Updated documentation and contrib/ examples, including the
	w1sensors.rb script that helps build configurations.
	Rationalised the gnome applets and added an appindicator for
	Ubuntu 11.04 (for Daria).

1.3.6 2011-04-01
	Add support for the HobbyBoards UV sensor (for Dave Johns, who
	loaned a sensor for development).
	Added configure for clock_nanosleep (so it builds on FreeBSD).
	Builds with gcc 4.6

1.3.5 2011-02-19
	Allow the postgresql module to work with psql v9.
	Tidied up some of the rate limiting code.
	Startup --wait works again (reported by Dave Johns)
	Updated the sample web page builder (contrib/web) to the current
	version

1.3.4 2011-01-16
	Modified the way "pressure_reduction_temp" works to avoid
	upsetting TAI8570 user who are *not* needing it.
	(reported by Dave Johns)
	Fixed ppc structure packing bug
	Fixed some small memory leaks

1.3.3 2010-11-28
	Add an option for QNH pressure reduction by using a user defined,
	fixed temperature, rather than the temperature read at the
	device. This requires the configuration file to contain the key
	"pressure_reduction_temp" with a value in °C (15°C for QNH), e.g.
	pressure_reduction_temp = 15
	(for Georges Rosset)
	Updated the manual.

1.3.2 2010-09-22
	Provide a sensible error message on failure to load a dynamic
	library (reported by John D Smith).

1.3.1 2010-02-11
	Added a "parameter" to the DS2423 counter. This is an offset which
	is applied to readings (useful if your rain gauge decides by
	itself to increment by 166592 on day, for no good reason. And then
	you replace it.

1.3.0 2009-11-01
	Updated the 'ratelimit' logic (reported by Graeme Gemmill).
	Updated some sqlite functionality (jh)

1.2.9 2009-06-25
	Corrected the check for the return value of clock_nanosleep (bug
	fix for infinite sleep syndrome).
	Allowed configuration parameters for the HB-BARO to be in SI units
	Added some otherwise undocumented configuration parameters (RTFS,
	but unlikely to be generally useful).
	Upgraded w1xml to use libxml2 for output.

	Updated the documentation.

1.2.8 2009-04-10
	Added support for the DS1921 (Thermochron) and DS1923 (Hygrochron)
	sensors. Support is limited to reading the instantaneous values of
	temperature (1921 & 1923) and relative humidity (1923) (for Leland
	Helgerson).

	w1find supports usb and usb-N (N=adaptor number) as an alias for
	DS2490-N (which the author can never remember.

	Updated documentation.

1.2.7 2009-03-23
	Added the ability to have a cycle time per sensor. Please see
	the documentation to enable this (for David Glasgow).

	Applet builds on Ubuntu Jaunty.

1.2.6 2008-11-08
	Added a standalone DS2450 device, for Mihail Peltekov, in order to
	support Mierij Meteo wind vanes. Updated the manual.

	Updated the message "Init fails: No w1_init() in init= loadable
	library" to a less cryptic:
	"Init fails: No w1_init() in init= loadable library
	 Please check the init= lines in your configuration file
	 and the manual entry 'Configuring the W1RETAP software'.
 	 This is typically a configuration error."

	Restored old behaviour where coupler devices could be specified as
	delimited list, rather than by individual RDBMS entries. Reported
	by, and patch provided by Will Sowerbutts.

	Added two new configuration file options
	log_delimiter = X (X = a single character or \t for TAB), defines
		the delimiter in the text log file (default is SPACE);
	log_time_t = X (if X is 1,y,Y,t,T then each text log file is
		appended with the time_t value of the timestamp).

	Added support for the iButtonLink MultiSensor MS-TC. The device
	memonic is "MS-TC", and the supported data type mnemonics are
	"current" "temp[erature]", "vad" and "vdd" (the latter three as
	for a DS2438 on which the device is based). based on code
	contibuted by Peter Parsons.

1.2.5 2008-08-10
	Relaxed the test for the libgio library in the contrib/w1temp
	configure stuff, as it's new enough not to be univerally
	available (reported by Stephen Searby).

	Updated the file based loggers CSV and XML in line with other file
	loggers (and use proper XML escapes).

1.2.4 2008-07-11
        Documentation update. Updates user guide and adds w1sensor.rb script
	to build an initial sensors configuration from w1find. Updates
	contrib scripts and examples. Relaxed sensor identification (for
	Mihail Peltekov, even if he doesn't know it:)

1.2.3	2008-06-20
	Fixed the (major,segv) bugs introduced by the 1.2.2 multi-sensor
	re-engineering, when the setup included DS2409 couplers (reported
	by Mihail Peltekov).

	Corrected a documentation error (reported by Graeme Gemmill).

1.2.2	2008-06-14
	Added MS-TH (Honeywell HiH4000 series) humidity (and temp)
	sensors. A side effect is supporting of the HobbyBoards humidity /
	temp sensor (for Mihail Peltekov & Dave Johns).
	Added DS2760 (HobbyBoards Leaf moisture etc), for Hans Fong.
	Removed the restriction of two sensors per ID, in a way which
	should be transparent to existing setups;
	Update the documentation;
	Hide database passwords in the '-v' data dump.

1.2.1	2008-04-25
	Fixes configure.ac for the case where libsqlite3-dev was not
	installed (reported by Dave Johns).

	Updated docs/README.usb to describe a udev script for contemporary
	udev / kernels (e.g. as released in Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron).

	Added a pertd example for displaying to the Pertelian X2040 LCD in
	docs/pert-log.rb

1.2.0	2008-04-13
	Support HobbyBoards 'Bitson' barometer. This is of type HB_BARO
	(or HB-BARO). As with the Bray, the calibration parameters (slope,
	offset are given in the 'params' field of the configuration table.

	For the Bray Barometer, allow params field to have either two or
	three values. If a third value is given it is assumed to be a
	fixed temperature (°C) for use in pressure normalisation.

	Allow the w1file 'filename' to be a pipe (popen(2)) when the
	initial character is '|' (requested by Mihail Peltekov).

1.1.0   2008-02-01
	Close and reopen log file on each write (Will Sowerbutts).

	Option to name /tmp/.wiretap.dat to something else (suggested by
	Mihail Peltekov to allow multiple daemons per machine).

1.0.9	2008-01-01
	There appears not to have been a 1.08.

	The VOLTAGE/DS2438 device returns the temperature if the name
	contains the text 'Temp'.

	If a device on a coupler appears in the sensors list twice (e.g. a
	DS2438 for vad/vdd and Temp), then it is now polled correctly.

	A new contrib/lcd4linux directory, which contains patches against
	lcd4linux 0.10.2-SVN. This makes it simple to display w1retap data
	on an lcd4linux supported device.

1.0.7	2007-10-21
	Fixed double free bug with MySQL if no ratelimit table. Thanks to
	Matti Airas for a question that prompted me to look at w1mysql.c

1.0.6	2007-10-06
	The default config file (/etc/defaults/w1retap) is now read if the
	user config file is not accessible (reported by Uwe Heidrich)

	Postgres allows one table per sensor if the 'abbrv' field is
	prefixed with a '>' character. e.g. if one gives a sensor an 'abbrv'
	value of 'rooftemperature', w1retap will continue to log sensor
	readings to the 'readings' table, exactly as before. However, if one
	sets the 'abbrv' to '>rooftemperature' (ie with a ">" as the first
	character) w1retap will instead insert just a date and value into a
	table named 'rooftemperature'. This allows one to have separate
	tables for certain sensors, while continuing to use the 'readings'
	table for others. Concept and patch by Will Sowerbutts.

	Improvements to wind vane code (Will Sowerbutts).

	Miscellaneous clean ups (JH and Will Sowerbutts).

1.0.5	2007-08-18
	Modified configure and pgsql/Makefile.am to allow building against
	postgreSQL installed on non-default paths. Problem reported by
	Andrejus (from Vilnius).
	Corrected "Init fails:success" message :)
	Updated the contrib/web examples so wplot.rb works with MySQL.

1.0.4   2007-07-10
	Fixes potential buffer overflow in w1util.c:w1_tmpfilelog.
	Reorganises some of the source files to make it a bit more
	maintainable.
	Removed popt dependency.

1.0.3   2007-04-22
        Changed the usb read for DS2490GetStatus() in libusbds2490.c to
	usb_interrupt_read(). This makes it work again on 2.6.20+ kernels.

1.0.2   2007-01-20
        Fixed a configure.ac typo and added some more MySQL checks.
        Renamed docs/README.udev to docs/README.usb and added some notes for
	older Linux systems still using hotplug.
	Check SHT-11 CRCs
	Changed to libpopt for argument parsing
	Vastly improved handling of coupler devices, contributed
	by William R Sowerbutts <http://sowerbutts.com>.
	Default data size changed to double (vice real).

1.0.1	2006-08-26
	Fix documentation errors (no code changes)

1.0	2006-08-22

	New functionality, so let's bump the version a bit. This is version
	1.0.

	Pgsql readings table is field order independent (patch contributed
	by William R Sowerbutts <http://sowerbutts.com>). Also applied to
	other databases.

	Altitude (for pressure normalisation) may be set in
	.config/w1retap/rc; if set, pressure will be normalised.
	e.g.
	 altitude = 19

	If you want to store 'raw' local pressure and do the conversion
	else where, then don't define the altitude key in the rc file.

       Timestamps may _optionally_ be stored as SQL TIMESTAMPs if the key

	timestamp = 1

	is set in .config/w1retap/rc. You must create appropriate table
	definition, example schemas and conversion code provided.

	Support for new devices
	* DS2409 Coupler (1)
	* DS2480B Serial interface (1)
	* SHT11 based humidity sensor
	 <http://home.hetnet.nl/~thomas_7/1Wire/1-WireIOPort.html> (1)
	* MPX4115A based pressure sensor ('fronted' by DS2438)
	 <http://home.comcast.net/~andrew.g.miller/barometer/> (1)
 	* TAI8515 Weather Vane (the other devices in the TAI8515,
          a DS2423 counter and DS18S20 temperature sensor are already
	  supported). The new code accesses the DS2405, so there is also
	  now support for the DS2450, although this is not obvious to the
	  end user. If you have another DS2450 application, let me
	  know. The code for the TAI8515 was contributed by Will
	  Sowerbutts.

	Sensor naming has been rationalised. Please read the manual for
	details. The old names are deprecated and may not be recognised in
	some future release

	The 'w1find' utility will walk the 1-wire network and report all
	devices. DS2409 Microlan couplers are supported, to a single depth
	(i.e. recursive coupler searching is not supported), but you may
	have multipe couplers on the network; in theory, will work with
	the 'Hobbyboards' multiple 2409 device.

	Detection of gnome-applets dependencies improved.

	A dist-bz2 target is provided.

	docs/fix* and docs/mksens*.sql scripts _if desired_ (e.g. for
	pressure normalisation, timestamps vice epoch times, sensor
	names).

	Updated manual (about time too).

	(1) Thanks to Mihail Peltekov <http://zlatograd.com> for providing
	ssh access to zlatograd.com to test these devices.
