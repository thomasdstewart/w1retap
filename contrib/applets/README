This folder consists of some simple GNOME applets (and an Indicator
App for Ubuntu 11.04 or later).

The Gnome3 applet will migrate to vala (vice C) once the vala bindings
catch up.

All the applets use a common settings file (~/.config/w1retap/applet),
which has the form:

[Config]
url=http://roo/wx/wx_static.dat
delay=120
key=temperature
browse-url=http://roo/wx/

where:

url: Is the URL to get a simple text file of format
     Key: value

delay: Is the cycle time to poll the url for text file

key: Is the key that references a temperature that provides the text
and icon.

browse: Is the url to browse the full data web page
