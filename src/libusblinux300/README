This is the Dallas libusblinux distribution available from
ftp://ftp.dalsemi.com/pub/auto_id/public/libusblinux300.tar.gz,
modified by Jonathan Hudson <jh+w1retap@daria.co.uk> for w1retap:

* Temperature module supports DS18B20
* Compiles with gcc 4.0
* 64 bit clean
* Added pressure.c for AAG TAI8570 pressure module
* Added MPX4115A and SHT11 based sensors
* Shared library choice of USB or RS232
* Added autoconf/automake for the bits w1retap uses

use:

make -f makefile.shrlib

to build all the Dalsemi stuff.

As part of w1retap, this is covered by the GPL, as the generous Dallas licence
allows; my changes are dual licenced under the GPL for w1retap, and the Dallas
PD licence, if you want to use the Dallas SDK for any other purpose outside
of w1retap.
